Begin by conducting keyword research for the 'Health and Wellbeing' niche to identify high-potential keywords. You will also analyze competitors and map URLs to target the most relevant keywords, with a minimum of 25 keywords required. Tools such as Ahrefs, Semrush, Google Keyword Planner, Writerzen, and UberSuggest should be used for this task. Once the keyword research is complete, you will move on to implementing an on-page SEO checklist. This includes ensuring the website is mobile-friendly and optimized for speed. Use GTMetrix and Mobile-Friendly Test to verify these aspects, and optimize URLs to make them short and user-friendly. You will also need to optimize the website's performance by using tools like WP Rocket, ShortPixel, and Cloudflare for caching, image optimization, and lazy loading. The next step involves addressing technical SEO, which includes fixing any mixed content issues, creating and submitting a sitemap, and ensuring the proper setup of robots.txt. Afterward, focus on optimizing on-page content by ensuring target keywords are present in URLs, titles, headings, and the first paragraph. You must use H1, H2, and H3 tags properly, add internal links to other pages on the website, and include outbound links to authoritative sites. Write compelling meta titles and descriptions for better search visibility. The next task is to optimize images by adding descriptive alt text, using relevant keywords in image file names, and compressing the images for better performance.
