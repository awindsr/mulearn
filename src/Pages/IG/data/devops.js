      "Having a basic understanding of programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript will help with automation and cloud applications. Having familiarity with operating systems (Linux and Windows) is important, as most tools run on these platforms. Having knowledge of version control systems like Git, basic networking concepts (IP addresses, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS), and virtualization (VMs, Docker) will also be helpful. Having familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud is an advantage but not required.",
