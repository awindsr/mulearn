        "AR/VR development requires a basic understanding of programming and 3D modeling. Familiarity with platforms like Unity or Unreal Engine, and languages such as C# (for Unity) or C++ (for Unreal Engine), is highly recommended. An understanding of spatial computing, graphics rendering, and interaction design is crucial. Basic knowledge of computer vision and ARKit/ARCore will also be beneficial.",
