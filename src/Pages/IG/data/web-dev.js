      "To get started, you should have basic computer skills and a foundational understanding of the internet. Knowledge of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is essential, along with a basic understanding of JavaScript. Familiarity with version control systems like Git and browser developer tools is important for debugging and collaboration. You should also be comfortable with responsive web design principles, which ensure websites work well on different devices. A basic grasp of graphic design principles is useful for creating visually appealing interfaces. Additionally, knowledge of web hosting, deployment, and web accessibility practices will help ensure your websites are accessible and functional.",
