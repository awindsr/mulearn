Knowledge of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is essential, along with a basic understanding of JavaScript. Familiarity with version control systems like Git and browser developer tools is important for debugging and collaboration. You should also be comfortable with responsive web design principles, which ensure websites work well on different devices.
